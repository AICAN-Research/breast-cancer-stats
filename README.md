## [Dependencies](https://github.com/andreped/breast-cancer-stats/edit/main/README.md#dependencies)

The Notebooks were tested against Python 3.8 on macOS operating system. However, they should be
quite robust against different setups. The following dependencies were used, and are
installed directly through the notebooks:

* [pandas](https://pypi.org/project/pandas/)
* [plotly](https://pypi.org/project/plotly/)
* [nbformat](https://pypi.org/project/nbformat/)
* [kaleido](https://pypi.org/project/kaleido/)
