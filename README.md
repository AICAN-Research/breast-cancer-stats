## [Dependencies](https://github.com/andreped/breast-cancer-stats#dependencies)

The Notebooks were tested against Python 3.8 on macOS operating system. Continuous integration tests are also performed for all notebooks
on Ubuntu 20.04 operating system (see [here](https://github.com/andreped/breast-cancer-stats/actions)). They are also compatible with
Google CoLab and should be quite robust against other setups.

The following dependencies were used and are installed as part of the notebooks:

* [pandas](https://pypi.org/project/pandas/)
* [plotly](https://pypi.org/project/plotly/)
* [nbformat](https://pypi.org/project/nbformat/)
* [kaleido](https://pypi.org/project/kaleido/)

## [Troubleshooting](https://github.com/andreped/breast-cancer-stats#troubleshooting)

If you attempt to run the notebooks locally or view them from GitHub, the resulting image may not be displayed.
This is due to the renderer in Plotly's `show()` method being set to `show(renderer="colab")`.
By removing the specification of renderer or choosing an appropriate renderer, the resulting image should be shown in the notebook.
